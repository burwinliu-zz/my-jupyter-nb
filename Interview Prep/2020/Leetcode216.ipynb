    "# Leetcode 216\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "All numbers will be positive integers.\n",
    "The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.\n",
    "## Thoughts\n",
    "This is a typical backtracking question, with limit next loop iterations based on what has already been. there is a possibility of doing this better without frozen sets and sets, but this ensures O(1) operations on check if item occured already, and therefore allowing for a better approach i think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution 2 has less space and time due to elimating a lot more possibilities on loop, only taking from n til end, not all elements except N per loop.\n",
    "## Analysis;\n",
    "Time: Large exponential numbers -- something I would not be able to derrive, something to do with Permutations\n",
    "Space: O(k) as this is a DFS style approach to backtracking"
