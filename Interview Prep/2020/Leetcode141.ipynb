    "Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.\n",

    "Classic two pointers, have a step cycle out of sync and eventually they will run into each other if there was a cycle.\n",

    "Hash map, makes things faster. Record each item, and if you see an item again, then you realize that there was a cycle within the map"
