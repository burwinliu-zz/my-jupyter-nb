    "## Problem\n",
    "Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thoughts\n",
    "A great explanation of this problem and the superset of this problem can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw6lrYANjz4)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 1\n",
    "Typical Bruteforce with O(NK) where k == number of transations (2) in this case, and O(NK) space. THis follows the idea that we can build off number of operations, store the information and return the constructed information by finding the current value of information on this many buys and sells, by finding the maximal amount of profiet from some prior sell at some other maximized location and a buy \n",
    "> (-prices[j] + memo[k][operations - 1])   \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we act to maximize at all locations -- but to prevent N extra work, we store the last maximized score, so we only need to compare against the last item and the prior maximized operations. Finally by adding on the current price, we can find the profit at this current location maximized with this amount of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 2\n",
    "By storing only the last two, we decrease the need for extra ks -- this dramatically improves space time if k was large (which in this case, it was not)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 3\n",
    "By only storing the last iteration of objects, we are able to save on space from O(NK) into O(1) \n"
