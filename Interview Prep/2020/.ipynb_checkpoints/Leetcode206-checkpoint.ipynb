    "Recursively is a bit more interesting. Base case would be when the Node is none, then just return None. In all other cases, the Recursively called next node is the self, and you set the next of the current node to be none so as not to potentially create infinite loops. Therefore, just reverse as you go, and return that final node (the base case)\n",
