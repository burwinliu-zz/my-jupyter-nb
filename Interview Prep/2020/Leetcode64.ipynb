    "# Leetcode 64\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.\n",
    "## Thoughts\n",
    "Honestly, this is slightly badly worded as a question. However, the essence of the idea is trying to find whether or not the last charect er is part of a 10 string of a valid bit or is a solo object given the contraints that each \"word\" is 10, 11, or 0.\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "Just merely loop through, and keeping track of position. Since theres only a few valid words and 01 is not a possibility, then therefore you can just keep a single pointer instead of needing to worry about branching. \n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "Since I am looping over every item in the space and only storing pointers, O(N) time, O(1) space"
