    "## Problem\n",
    "The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the \"root.\" Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that \"all houses in this place forms a binary tree\". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.\n",

    "This is an extension of the \"House Robber\" Series (see [here](Leetcode198.ipynb) and [here](Leetcode213.ipynb)). Overall, due to the fact that you are searching for a max value, but each branch can have its own value, you must treat each branch as a seperate value. Therefore, you are comparing in 2 cases -- with root, or without -- in with root case, you take the maximum, with the next node down as invalid -- otherwise, then add the next two items. Therefore, recursion to compare\n",
