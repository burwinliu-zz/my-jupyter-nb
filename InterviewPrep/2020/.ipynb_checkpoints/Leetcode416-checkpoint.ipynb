    "## Problem\n",
    "Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each of the array element will not exceed 100.\n",
    "* The array size will not exceed 200.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thoughts \n",
    "One of the toguhest DP problems I have encountered so far ( That I could solve ). Initially I was looking to partition into two buckets and backtracking to see if we could divide it into two -- later realizing with some discussion posts that we could simply sum up the total and divide into two and see if one half could fill one bucket -- after all if one is filled, then the other is as well automatically. I wonder how N buckets would be filled -- divide into x buckets, and then try to fill each by combination? I think DFS or backtracking is the feasible solution, but who knows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "With knapsack 1/0 we realize that we are trying to optimize to find the total given values. Therefore, we take a M\\*N array with a combinations -- do we choose the current selected num (N that we are on) and can we sum up to the current point (by taking prev - current num val + current num val) -- by maximizing we choose whichever is closest to the \"goal\" value\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "By using True and False, store less information and optimize space more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "Time: O(M\\*N) where M is the midpoint of the total sum and N is the number of numbers -- to parse through all possible combinations\n",
    "Space: O(2) Since we optimized, realizing only two rows were necessary to parse through everything"
