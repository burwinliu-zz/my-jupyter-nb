    "## Problem\n",
    "We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each turn, we choose any two rocks and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:\n",
    "\n",
    "If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;\n",
    "If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.\n",
    "At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the smallest possible weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thoughts\n",
    "I initially went about this a completely different way then was intended -- using a 2d map array to try and find all combinations of numbers but current number, then finding the minimum at the end. However, if I went about looking at the esence of the problem, I would have seen that we are supposed to be looking for the sum of all items to the midway point to allow for the \"smashing\" to a minimum amount -- as both sides would be paired off, leaving the reaminder of the two halves removed be left. Therefore, a form of knapsack -- as given "
