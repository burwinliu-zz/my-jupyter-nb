    "# Sockets\n",
    "\n",
    "In sockets, there are a basic set of protocols that occur on connect. To be setup using WINSOCK or SOCKET (windows and linux respectively)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Server Side\n",
    "Initially, the server must be set up before the client tries to connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Socket creation -- socket(addr_fam_spec, type, protocol) \n",
    "make a socket\n",
    "#### addr_fam_spec\n",
    "Server must open up a port that initializes the socket. addr_fam_spec is the address family specification(AF_INET (IPv4 protocol) , AF_INET6 (IPv6 protocol)), which informs the socket what form of address protocol they are using (layer 3 in OSI model, the Network Layer)\n",
    "#### type\n",
    "Informs the socket of what form of communication is being used. The communication type will be used to inform what type of Communication protocol is being used (SOCK_STREAM: 2 way stream, SOCK_DGRAM: datagrams, which are connectionless, unreliable buffers of a fixed (typically small) maximum length, and more) \n",
    "#### protocol\n",
    "Protocol value for Internet Protocol(IP). The numeric identification of the upper layer protocol that an IP packet should be sent to. The number is stored in the header that is prefixed to an IP packet. (Bluetooth? TCP? UDP?)\n",
    "#### return-value\n",
    "Returns a SOCKET DESCRIPTOR which is a representation of where the sockets information may be found. In essence, this is like a file descriptor, or how an open file object can know where to read and write to when called in the form of a stream. The other option is some indication of error (usually -1) where the errno is set or wsagetlasterror is set, which can subsequently recieve the info.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure options -- setsockopt(int sockfd, int level, int optname, const void \\*optval, socklen_t optlen)\n",
    "Set options for the socket (optional)\n",
    "#### sockfd \n",
    "sockfd is the socket file descriptor (see above, Socket creation return value)\n",
    "#### level\n",
    "The \"level\" at which a socket opt is defined. See here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winsock/nf-winsock-setsockopt or https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/setsockopt.html for more info on sockopt level or \n",

    "bind the socket to the correct address and config\n",
    "#### sockfd\n",
    "sockfd is the socket file descriptor (see above, Socket creation return value)\n",
    "#### addr\n",
    "addr is the pointer to a struct called addrinfo, which can be found via getaddrinfo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getaddrinfo). This struct contains info on hostname (127.0.0.1 by default when not set (NULL)), service (port number/service name), hints (another addrinfo when needed or NULL), res (pointer to another addrinfo with info requested after success\n",
    "#### addrlen \n",
    "Lenghth of the object addr points to\n",
    "\n",
    "### listen -- listen(int sockfd, int backlog)\n",
    "Put in a temporary stasis status where we wait for a socket to be approached.\n",
    "#### sockfd\n",
    "It has a sockfd which is the socket it listens on to wait for connection (see above, Socket creation return value)\n",
    "#### backlog\n",
    "Defines the maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for sockfd may grow\n",
    "\n",
    "### accept -- accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr \\*addr, socklen_t \\*addrlen)\n",
    "Accept a socket at the top of the listen stack and creates a socket to listen to it\n",
    "#### sockfd \n",
    "The sockfd where the socket listens on to wait for connection (see above, Socket creation return value)\n",
    "#### addr \n",
    "An addrinfo structure on the accepted connection info (see addr in bind)\n",
