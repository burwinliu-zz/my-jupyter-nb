This protocol defines a header with Checksums and other information which is then in turn used to verify the authenticity and correctness of the transfered data in the body. Furthermore, it uses congestion controls to ensure that there is not any \"congestion\" that occurs as information is being transfered via congestion windows (dictating how much data to be sent out at a given time) slow start (avoiding sending out more data then the network can handle) and faste retransmit (to ensure that once data is sent, and if it fails, retransmits as many times quickly to get the msg out)  \n",
